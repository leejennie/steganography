#The following code is based on the code written by reachsumit on github. The URL for the page is https://gist.github.com/reachsumit/583c76ffd740e1a952d65da3c676931f. This is the file to decode the enhanced LSB message in from enhanced.py and the modifications to the code is to decode the message based on the enhancement..
#There are still issues with this code. Does not properly decode the enhanced version of encoding a message

import sys
import wave as wav

#Step 1: Get signal file to write and the associated information with the file
wavfile = wav.open(sys.argv[1], 'rb')
#channels per frame
channels = wavfile.getnchannels()
#bytes per sample
width = wavfile.getsampwidth()
#sample rate
rate = wavfile.getframerate()
#number of frames
frames = wavfile.getnframes()
#length of frames
frame_width = width * channels

#Step 2: Read frames
wave_bytes = wavfile.readframes(frames)

#Step 3: Convert to byte array
frame_bytes = bytearray(list(wave_bytes))

#Step 3: Extract the LSB of each byte in the wav file to get bits of the message encoded in the wav file
#extract_LSB = [frame_bytes[i] & 1 for i in range(len(frame_bytes))]
for i in range(len(frame_bytes)):

      extract_LSB = [(frame_bytes[i] & 1 << 1)] 
      
#Step 4: Get the message by converting the byte array back to the string 
decode_message = ''.join(chr(int(''.join(map(str, extract_LSB[i:i+8])), 2)) for i in range(0, len(extract_LSB), 8))

#Step 5: Get rid of the filler characters 
decoded = decode_message.split('#')[0]

#Step 6: Print out the message
